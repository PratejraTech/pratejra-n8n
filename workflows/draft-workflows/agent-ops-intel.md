Name: AgentOps
Description:
AgentOps is an Operations Intelligence tool designed to gather comprehensive telemetry and operational information from Cursor via an MCP Server. It collects and collates diverse types of telemetry, such as system health metrics (CPU, memory, disk usage), agent status and uptime, alert and incident logs, network performance, user activity, and configuration changes. This data is then displayed on an interactive dashboard, enabling operations teams to monitor real-time agent performance, diagnose issues quickly, track trends over time, and ensure adherence to operational policies. Telemetry enables proactive incident response, resource optimization, anomaly detection, and detailed auditing, providing a robust foundation for decision-making and continuous service improvement.
